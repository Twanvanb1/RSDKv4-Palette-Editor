# RSDKv4 Palette Editor
###### Because RetroED v2 isn't done yet

Very basic GUI tool for editing RSDKv4 global palettes stored in GameConfig.bin.

### How to Use

1. Run the .exe
2. Click "Open"
3. Select the GameConfig.bin file you want to edit
4. Modify the colours
5. Click "Save"

### Notes

- This is only compatible with RSDKv4 (i.e. Sonic 1 / 2), <B>DO NOT OPEN GAMECONFIG.BIN FROM SONIC CD / MANIA</B>
- Character fur colour is stored in the PlayerObject script, changing it here will not affect player sprites
