# RSDKv4 Palette Editor
###### Because RetroED v2 isn't done yet

Very basic GUI tool for editing RSDKv4 global and stage palettes.

### How to Use

1. Run the .exe
2. Click "Open"
3. Select the GameConfig.bin file in the data folder
4. Select the palette you want to change in the list
5. Modify the colours
6. Click "Save"

### Notes

- This is only compatible with RSDKv4 (i.e. Sonic 1 / 2), <B>DO NOT OPEN GAMECONFIG.BIN FROM SONIC CD / MANIA</B>
- Character fur colour is stored in the PlayerObject script, changing it here will not affect player sprites
